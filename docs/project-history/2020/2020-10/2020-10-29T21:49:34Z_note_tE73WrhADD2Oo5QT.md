Today I wrote an initial STM32 timer driver using capture/compare mode to generate an interrupt.

One problem that resurfaced was the boot failure in the startup code. Previously we had reverted the __bss_start__ end address so that __data_end__ would be used instead. In the past, this resolved a boot problem... but now it made a problem reappear!

It does seem that the global offset tables need to be moved to RAM, so I've restored this code for now.

I'm not happy that it keeps giving me problems.
